### *Who I actually am*
My name is Oisin. I make music sometimes online. I don't have anything to really say as I'm just a regular person. I got a pretty decent vinyl record collection valued at around $1.2k median on Discogs.

I've been working on music since about 10 years old, and in the last 5 years I've been working using Ableton Live Suite. For legal reasons I cannot confirm or deny if I legally purchased it as it is over $1k to buy.

This account was made as a part of my Year 11 DigiTech class. I chose DigiTech as I think learning a programming language would be a useful skill in the future, especially as I have projects in mind that I want to eventually do.

### ***My future Aspirations***
Obviously I would love to make music for a living, but unless you become famous you probably won't make a living wage from it. Because of that, I'm most likely going into Cyber Security. I got a pretty decent grasp on what different attacks are (e.g SQL Injection or XSS) and how to defend against them, and with our society utilizing technology more every day I would presume that the demand for Cyber Security Analysts would go up.
